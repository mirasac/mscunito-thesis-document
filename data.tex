\section{Data}
\label{sec:Data}
Climate data show great complexity in structure and availability (e.g. \glspl{ECV} can be represented as multidimensional objects, some climate datasets are collections of \glspl{ECV}). For these and other properties discussed in \cite{2014FaghmousABig}, climate data can be regarded as big data.

In this work a generic \gls{ECV} $T$ can be represented mathematically as a scalar function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:math_variable}
  T : S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{time} \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{lat}$, $S_\text{lon}$ and $S_\text{time}$ are domains of latitude, longitude and time dimensions, respectively.%
\footnote{In contexts related to Machine Learning these objects are called tensors. Since they may not satisfy the mathematical definition of a tensor, in particular the map may not be multilinear and the numerical sets may not be vector spaces, no reference to such objects is made in this work.}
Every numerical value is equipped with proper units of measurement, to represent physical quantities correctly. As a consequence, the codomain in equation~\eqref{eq:math_variable} is partially wrong: with an abuse of notation, it represents only the magnitude of the \gls{ECV} and does not consider the unit of measurement. This is a small exception to simplify the notation and in the remainder of this document units of measurement are always addressed explicitly.

A more practical representation of $T$ is a multidimensional array, where values in the domain are coordinates associated to each dimension and each entry of the array is the result of $T$ evaluated on those coordinates. Figure~\ref{fig:multidimensional} shows this representation visually.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics*[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.75\textwidth]{multidimensional}
  \caption{Representation of a generic \gls{ECV} as multidimensional array.}
  \label{fig:multidimensional}
\end{figure}
In the following, this representation is used to simplify the discussion and same \gls{ECV} name is used both for the function and the multidimensional array.
\begin{example}
  Near-Surface Air Temperature, symbol $\tas$, is available for some coordinates and timestamps. It can be seen as the scalar function in equation~\eqref{eq:math_variable}, which associates each value in set $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{time}$ to a value with unit \unit{\kelvin}, or it can be represented as the multidimensional array in figure~\ref{fig:multidimensional}, where each entry is function~\eqref{eq:math_variable} evaluated at the corresponding coordinates.
\end{example}

As a visual aid when generic symbols are used, capital letters represent both functions and multidimensional arrays, the former being followed by the arguments in parentheses when there is an explicit reference to their values. Instead, lowercase letters are used for functions and values which are one dimensional.

\Glspl{normal} used as reference depends only on spatial coordinates, hence they are functions
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:math_normal}
  \bar{T} : S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
or equivalently, multidimensional arrays with spatial coordinates only.
\Glspl{normal} are evaluated as explained in \cite[6]{2017WorldMeteorologicalOrganizationWMOWMOGuidelines} using an averaging period $S_\text{clim}$ specific to each case study (cf. section~\ref{sec:Case study}).

\Glspl{indicator} of \glspl{driver} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} are functions of \glspl{ECV} and additional parameters. In general they are aggregated over the temporal dimension and are non-linear functions of their arguments.
An \gls{indicator} $I$ can be defined mathematically as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:math_indicator}
  I : S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{y} \times \prod_{p \in P_I} S_p \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{y}$ is a set of the years considered during the analysis, $P_I$ is the set of parameters for that indicator and $S_p$ is the set of values available for each parameter $p \in P_I$.%
\footnote{As a symbolic shortcut, if $P_I = \varnothing$ then the indicator is defined only over $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{y}$.}
In this work their evaluation is performed for each year, i.e. the \gls{indicator} has yearly resolution or is evaluated with yearly frequency. As a consequence, the elements of set $S_\text{y}$ are references to the years taken into account during calculations.

An \gls{indicator} can be represented as a multidimensional array, similarly to \glspl{ECV}.
The dependence of an \gls{indicator} on \glspl{ECV} is not clear in the definition given by equation~\eqref{eq:math_indicator}, but in the following this is made explicit by the context or by the definition of the \gls{indicator}.

\begin{example}
  The \gls{indicator} $\mathrm{TX_x}$ is evaluated for the period 1991-2020 with yearly frequency. This \gls{indicator} is the monthly maximum value of daily maximum temperature,\cite{ETCCDIClimate} hence:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item it depends on \gls{ECV} $\tasmax$ defined at daily frequency over the considered period,
      \begin{equation*}
        S_\text{time} = \left\{ t : \parbox{0.45\linewidth}{$t$ day from \DTMdisplaydate{1991}{1}{1}{-1} to \DTMdisplaydate{2020}{12}{31}{-1}} \right\}
        \quad ;
      \end{equation*}
    \item spatial dimensions are not specified, hence the evaluation is performed for each point of an arbitrary set $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon}$;
    \item no additional parameters are required, $P_\mathrm{TX_x} = \varnothing$;
    \item the outcome is a scalar value for each year in the period,
      \begin{equation*}
        S_\text{y} = \{ 1991, 1992, \dots, 2020 \}
        \quad ;
      \end{equation*}
    \item the multidimensional array representation of the \gls{indicator} is in the following figure, where each entry is a real value with unit \unit{\kelvin}:
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics*[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.50\linewidth]{indicator_climatological_standard_normal}
      \end{center}
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\Glspl{indicator} of \glspl{driver} within \gls{exposure} and \gls{vulnerability} \glspl{determinant} may be defined similarly as the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} as scalar functions depending on specific variables characterising the system.
