\section{Data}
Climate data show great complexity in structure and availability. For these and other properties they can be regarded as big data.\cite{2014FaghmousABig}
Each \gls{ECV} can be represented as a multidimensional object and in this work a generic \gls{ECV} $E$ is represented mathematically as a scalar function
\begin{equation}
  E : D_\text{time} \times D_\text{lat} \times D_\text{lon} \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where $D_\text{time}$, $D_\text{lat}$ and $D_\text{lon}$ are domains of time, latitude and longitude coordinates, respectively.%
\footnote{In Machine Learning-related fields these objects are called tensors. Since they may not satisfy the mathematical definition of a tensor, in particular the numerical sets over which they are defined may not be vector spaces, in this work no reference to multilinear algebra is made.}
