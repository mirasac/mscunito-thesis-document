\section{Conceptual overview}
\label{sec:Conceptual overview}
Climate change is shaping ecosystems and human activities and is becoming a central topic of discussion across all fields \cite{2022IPCCClimateChange,2022PortnerTechnicalSummary}. Effects of climate change have different severity, often changing with time and with the evolution of contexts they occur \cite{2024EEAExecutiveSummary}. These impacts may depend also on the spatial scale of the systems affected \cite{2021Doblas-ReyesLinkingGlobal}.

The knowledge of present and future impacts of climate change becomes essential to reduce adverse outcomes, as well as to leverage potential benefits. Even more relevant is the concept of risk which moves the focus from the impacts to their potential occurrence, broadening the possibilities for related studies and actions.
In fact, an increasing number of organisations are incorporating \glspl{CCRA} into their decision processes \cite{2024Carlin2024Climate}. A definition of \gls{risk_assessment} is given by \gls{IPCC} as \glsdesc{risk_assessment}, and \gls{CCRA} is its restriction to climate-related \glspl{risk}.%
\footnote{Terms \emph{climate change risk assessment} and \emph{climate risk assessment} are used equivalently in literature (cf. \cite[11]{2017GIZRiskSupplement} and \cite[20]{2017GIZTheVulnerability}, also \cite{2024LoyerInventoryOf}). In this document the former is used, to highlight the focus on risks arising from climate change.}
Other authorities employ similar definitions of \gls{risk_assessment} and remark its usefulness \cite{2021ISO14091,2019UNDRRGlobalAssessment}.

More generally, a \gls{risk_assessment} is essential part of the process of \gls{risk_management}, which uses the assessed information to reduce risk through the application of, e.g. policies, strategies, adaptation plans \cite{2018ISO31000}. The objectives of \gls{risk_management} are defined in the broad field of \gls{DRR} \cite{2016UNSecretary-GeneralReportOf}.

\Gls{CCRA} combines \gls{DRR} practices and concepts with climate information \cite{2017GIZRiskSupplement,2012FieldManagingThe}. Some insights on the synergy between the fields of \gls{DRR} and climate change adaptation are exposed in \cite[469-471]{2012FieldManagingThe}.

Credible climate information are refined by scientific data and in cooperation with users and stakeholders. They are the product of \glspl{climate_service}, being the provision of climate-related data and information to assist decision-making \cite{2012HewittTheGlobal}. An overview of the evolving field of \glspl{climate_service} is available in \cite[1431-1433]{2021Doblas-ReyesLinkingGlobal} and in \cite[1862-1869]{2021RanasingheClimateChange}.

Various regulations, standards and guidelines for \gls{CCRA} are available, but very few specify in detail the methodology to follow \cite{2024LoyerInventoryOf}. Methodologies differ by various means, e.g. the steps required to gather preliminar information on impacts and risks, the analysis of the system exposed, the evaluation of risk and its components, the presentation of outcomes (cf. \cite{2021ISO14091,2024EEAExecutiveSummary,2017GIZTheVulnerability,2014BowyerAdaptingTo,2024EU20212139}, also see \cite[10-11]{2024LoyerInventoryOf} and \cite[9]{2017GIZRiskSupplement}). This variety hinders the comparison of \gls{CCRA} outcomes, diminishing their credibility and interoperability \cite{2022HainLetsGet}.

A single methodology may be chosen to perform the \gls{CCRA}, but the issue presents once again since the methodology may not define operational details, e.g. functions and procedures involved. Implementation details are left to the authors of the \gls{CCRA}, who base the choice on their experience and on scientific literature, according to the principles of \glspl{climate_service}.
To evaluate the dependence of \gls{risk} on the functional representation of its components is the objective of this work.

The methodology of \gls{CCRA} applied in the present work follows \cite{2017GIZTheVulnerability} and its upgrade \cite{2017GIZRiskSupplement}. The latter should be read in parallel with the former and supersedes outdated concepts.



\subsection{Climate risk}
\label{sec:Climate risk}
Before stating the objective of the present study, first it is convenient to introduce a proper terminology.
Definitions by \gls{ISO} are used for their concision. When some terms are not available, they are taken from \gls{IPCC}. Both sources have similar definitions for the same terms.

\Gls{risk} is a general term which can be tailored to different contexts and applications as a measure of uncertain consequences on a system of interest.%
\footnote{Without delving into Philosophy, a source of change is needed to have consequences and it is specified by the definitions in use.}
A system is very broadly any concrete or abstract entity which can be affected by \gls{risk}.
\begin{example}
  Some possible systems which can be exposed to \glspl{risk} are any physical system, communities of people, an idea.
\end{example}
A paradigmatic example is the financial sector, where the concept of \gls{risk} is widely known and is connected directly to economic value and the concept of portfolio, to the point that financial risk management can be considered a research field itself \cite{2004ChristoffersenElementsOf}.
Examples on how other fields implement the concept are elaborated in \cite[14]{2017GIZRiskSupplement} and in \cite{2020ReisingerTheConcept}.

In this work the \gls{risk} related to climate change is: \glsdesc{risk}.%
\footnote{Note that this definition is not specific to climate \gls{risk} since no reference to climate is made.}
\Gls{IPCC} proposes a similar definition, expanding on the entities involved (e.g. the possible systems) and the contexts in which the term is used, but focusing only on negative effects: \glsuseri{risk}.
An important aspect of climate \gls{risk} is that it originates from both \gls{impact} of climate change, i.e. \glsdesc{impact}, and any response to it, i.e. \glsdesc{response}. It is not common to see \glspl{response} integrated into risk assessment, as exposed by \cite[492]{2021SimpsonAFramework}, and for the purposes of the present study they are neglected.
From this perspective, two types of climate \gls{risk} are studied in \glspl{CCRA}: transition risk and physical risk. The former regards \glspl{impact} on finance, economy and society caused by decarbonisation and transitioning to a sustainable economy, the latter is the risk related to the realisation of physical hazards. Both types of risk are assessed by organisations and financial institutions \cite{2023CarlinThe2023,2023CarlinTechnicalSupplement}. Physical risks are further divided in acute and chronic, for extreme weather events and long term impacts, respectively \cite[10]{2023CarlinThe2023}.
Henceforth, terms climate \gls{risk} and risk are used interchangeably and both refer to climate-related physical risks.

To make the assessment easily extensible and modular, \gls{risk} is defined as the result of the interaction of three elements, i.e. its \glspl{determinant}, namely \gls{hazard}, \gls{exposure} and \gls{vulnerability}. \Gls{response} is considered the fourth \gls{determinant} of \gls{risk}, when the adopted methodology includes it in the assessment.
Definitions of \glspl{determinant} were introduced in \cite[69-70]{2012FieldManagingThe} and offer a change of direction from previous methodologies centered on the concept of \gls{vulnerability} of the system instead of the overall \gls{risk} (cf. \cite{2017GIZTheVulnerability} and \cite{2017GIZRiskSupplement}).

The \gls{hazard} is defined by \gls{ISO} as \glsdesc{hazard} and is elaborated further by \gls{IPCC} on which subjects it applies to. No particular reference is made to the climate system in the definitions, hence \gls{IPCC} provides the more specific term \gls{CID} in \cite[2224]{2021MatthewsAnnexVII} to address to climate-related physical phenomena and with a neutral connotation (cf. \cite[10]{2020ReisingerTheConcept} or \cite[1871-1872]{2021RanasingheClimateChange}). In the following the term \gls{hazard} is used to address to climate-related \glspl{hazard} for brevity.

The \gls{exposure} of a system is determined by \glsdesc{exposure}.

The \gls{vulnerability} of a system is \glsdesc{vulnerability}. Properties of the system which determine its \gls{vulnerability} may be classified further in \gls{sensitivity}, i.e. \glsdesc{sensitivity}, and \gls{adaptive_capacity}, i.e. \glsdesc{adaptive_capacity}. This classification in general helps the analysis of the system and the identification of responses, e.g. \gls{adaptation} measures may increase the \gls{adaptive_capacity} of some elements of the system.

Each \gls{determinant} may be viewed as a collection of elements, which are of different nature depending on the \gls{determinant} they belong to, but are addressed generically as \glspl{driver}.%
\footnote{When this terminology is not applied, it is common to refer to \glspl{driver} with the name of the \glspl{determinant} they belong to, e.g. drivers within the \gls{vulnerability} determinant are simply called vulnerabilities.}
\Glspl{CID} with negative \glspl{impact} are effectively \glspl{driver} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} which are related to the climate system.
Physical elements of the system may be effectively considered as \glspl{driver} of \gls{exposure}.%
\footnote{In literature different terms are used to refer to \glspl{driver} within the \gls{exposure}, e.g. \emph{assets} or \emph{exposed sample} in \cite{2022DeVivoRiskAssessment}.}
\begin{example}
  A tropical storm is a \gls{driver} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} \cite[15]{2017GIZRiskSupplement}, income is a \gls{driver} within the \gls{vulnerability} \gls{determinant} \cite[493]{2021SimpsonAFramework}, airport structures (e.g. runways, aprons, terminals) in an airport (i.e. the system) are \glspl{driver} within the \gls{exposure} \gls{determinant} \cite[551]{2022DeVivoRiskAssessment}. More examples are available in the references.
\end{example}
The concept of \gls{driver} of \gls{risk} is borrowed from \cite{2021SimpsonAFramework} to allow a smooth extension to methodologies where \gls{risk} is the result of complex interactions within and across \glspl{determinant}. In section~\ref{sec:Complex risk} this topic is described further.

For a quantitative \gls{CCRA}, numerical values must be associated to \glspl{driver}. These values are called \glspl{indicator} and defined by \gls{ISO} as: \glsdesc{indicator}.%
\footnote{The definition by \gls{IPCC} is not as general because focuses only on the climate system and there is no specific term for the same concept applied to the other \glspl{determinant}.}
There can be more than one way to describe numerically the same \gls{driver}, hence the choice is not unique and the resulting risk may be affected by it.
\begin{example}
  A \gls{drought} is defined in general by \gls{IPCC} as \glsdesc{drought}. Drought is a \gls{driver} of \gls{risk} and is a physical phenomena related to climate, hence it belongs to the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant}.
  
  Many \glspl{indicator} of drought are used, e.g. consecutive number of dry days, temperature, indicators combining temperature,precipitation and evotranspiration. See \cite[167-169]{2012FieldManagingThe} for further examples and references; note that the term \emph{index} is used in place of indicator.
\end{example}
In the following, the term \gls{indicator} written alone refers to an \gls{indicator} of a \gls{driver} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant}, to relax the lenghty wording. For the other \glspl{determinant} the full qualification is used.

Having introduced the definitions above, the various components of \gls{risk} can be arranged as in figure~\ref{fig:nomenclature}. It sums up the relation between the various components, highlightning the fact that risk depends on drivers from three independent categories and are quantified possibly in multiple ways.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics*[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.75\textwidth]{nomenclature}
  \caption{A possibile representation of the components of climate risk. Climate hazards can affect exposed and vulnerable elements of the system and determine a risk for it. Collectively these factors are called drivers and can grouped in the three independent determinants of risk: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. To provide quantitative results, each driver is described by numerical values, i.e. the indicators, each providing a different possible description or measure of the same driver.}
  \label{fig:nomenclature}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Complex risk}
\label{sec:Complex risk}
Unlike other types of risk assessment, e.g. probabilistic risk assessment, \gls{CCRA} focuses on interactions between \glspl{driver} instead of estimating their likelihood \cite[20-21]{2017GIZRiskSupplement}. However, it is common to study each \gls{determinant} in isolation. Instead, an integrated risk assessment which is able to relate \glspl{driver} within and across \glspl{determinant} would be able to describe the overall \gls{risk} more accurately \cite[145-147]{2022BegumPointOf}.

Interacting elements are not considered mainly because a proper formalisation of the interactions is difficult and rarely clear. In \cite{2021SimpsonAFramework} the list of complex \gls{risk} adopted by \gls{IPCC} in \gls{AR6} is extended, to allow more granularity in the assessment, and three categories of complex \gls{risk} are proposed. The objective is to build a framework which helps to address to complex interactions more easily, thus helping their adoption in \glspl{CCRA}. \Gls{response} is included in the \glspl{determinant}, e.g. to introduce negative effects on \gls{vulnerability} due to \gls{maladaptation}.
Depending on what is the origin of \gls{risk}, the categories are:\cite[493]{2021SimpsonAFramework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{itm:category_1} interacting \glspl{driver} within the same \gls{determinant};
  \item \label{itm:category_2} interacting \glspl{driver} across different \glspl{determinant};
  \item \label{itm:category_3} interacting \glspl{risk}.
\end{enumerate}
In general, category~\ref{itm:category_1} is considered as long as the methodology admits an aggregation of \glspl{driver} to obtain each \gls{determinant}.
\begin{example}
  Flood \gls{risk} in a geographical area is assessed. First, only artificial constructions are considered as system.
  The change in time of precipitation and temperature, i.e. \glspl{driver} of \gls{risk} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant}, are aggregated to give a measure of the \gls{hazard}. With this value and the analogous values of the other \glspl{determinant}, a category~\ref{itm:category_1} \gls{risk} can be evaluated, which measures the interaction of its \glspl{determinant} only defined by the methodology and lacking a particular meaning.
  
  A collateral change in soil properties due to precipitation and temperature is added to the study. This results in a decrease of soil \gls{adaptive_capacity}, hence an increase of the \gls{vulnerability} of buildings in that area. This interaction belongs to category~\ref{itm:category_2}.
  
  A second iteration of the \gls{CCRA} moves the focus to human activities in the area under study. When the corrispondent \gls{risk} is evaluated, it can be merged with the \gls{risk} value found previously to summarise the overall flood \gls{risk}, which becomes a category~\ref{itm:category_3} complex \gls{risk}.
\end{example}

All three categories of complex \gls{risk} may be found in the methodology (see section~\ref{sec:Methodology of risk assessment} for details), but in the present work only category~\ref{itm:category_1} is considered, as there is no particular relation between \glspl{driver} within different \glspl{determinant}, except for the aggregation into the final \gls{risk} value.
Nevertheless, extending the current study by introducing complexity throught the other categories may be interesting to test the robustness of the results.

From a mathematical point of view, complex interactions between \glspl{driver} translate to mathematical functions which relate \glspl{indicator}. They may be treated as additional \glspl{indicator} to consider in the aggregation of \glspl{determinant} \cite[39-40]{2008OECDHandbookOn}.
In the chosen methodology, no specific interaction is considered between drivers across determinants. This translates into linear relations between indicators when they are aggregated.



\subsection{Problem statement}
The objective of this work is to show how the \gls{risk} evaluated following a given methodology depends on the choice of \glspl{indicator}. In particular, the study is restricted to indicators of \gls{hazard} and their definitions are modified by varying the parameters they depend on.

Technically this study resembles a \gls{SA}: the effects on the outcome of a system by varying its input factors are assessed and attributed to specific input factors \cite[627-632]{2015DeanHandbookOf}. In this case the system is the \gls{CCRA} and the methodology which implements it, its outcome is the \gls{risk} value and the input factors are the parameters.
More in detail, this work adopts a global approach to \gls{SA}, since the space of all possible parameters, or a significative subset of it, is explored. This is essential for a significative \gls{SA}, because \glspl{indicator} are generally non-linear functions of their parameters, hence the relation of the system on the input space is highly non linear \cite[31-32]{2019SaltelliWhySo}.

A \gls{SA} is normally preceded by an \gls{UA}, which quantifies the uncertainty on the output of the system by exploring the statistical properties of the system and its inputs \cite[29-30]{2019SaltelliWhySo}. The present study does not employ strictly an \gls{UA}, because probability distributions of parameters and their uncertainties are not considered explicitly, a non-parametric space-filling approach is adopted instead.
An estimation of uncertainties would be possible by employing multiple instances of the input space (e.g. bootstrapping, Monte Carlo methods). Additionally, uncertainties on climate data are considered only for projections, where a model ensemble is employed.

Results from this work highlight the importance of \glspl{indicator} parameters in a \gls{CCRA}, e.g. thresholds \cite[1873-1874]{2021RanasingheClimateChange}. The methods may be useful to authors of \glspl{CCRA} to address the arbitrariness of parameters selection and to support the outcomes of the assessment. In this regard, the present study may found an application in \glspl{climate_service}.



\section{Climate data}
\label{sec:Climate data}
Climate is a complex system, composed by many elements which interact in non-trivial (i.e. non-linear) ways. Therefore, to have a satisfying description of climate, many variables are needed. Climate data are data which can be used to provide a direct or indirect description of climate,%
\footnote{A note on nomenclature: the adjective \emph{climatological} is used in some sources instead of \emph{climate} to address to climate data. They are equivalent, but the latter is preferred in this work because it replicates the alternative term for \gls{normal} specified by \cite[1]{2017WorldMeteorologicalOrganizationWMOWMOGuidelines}.}
e.g. in situ observations, measures from remote sensing or weather stations, outputs from numerical models \cite[1537]{2021SeneviratneWeatherAnd}. The complexity of climate reflects on the complexity in structure of climate data, e.g. they can be represented as multidimensional objects and collected in climate datasets. This affects also their availability and other properties \cite{2014FaghmousABig}, therefore climate data can be regarded as big data.

To identify a subset of variables which efficiently describe the climate, the concept of \gls{ECV} is defined \cite{2014BojinskiTheConcept}. The updated list of \glspl{ECV} and their requirements are mantained by the \gls{WMO} in \cite[14-17]{2022WorldMeteorologicalOrganizationWMOThe2022}.
Climate data necessary for this study are among the present \glspl{ECV}. In this section they are characterised mathematically, while the actual data are shown in section~\ref{sec:Results and Discussion}.

In the following, a generic \gls{ECV} $T$ can be represented mathematically as a scalar function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:math_variable}
  T : S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{time} \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{lat}$, $S_\text{lon}$ and $S_\text{time}$ are domains of latitude, longitude and time dimensions, respectively.%
\footnote{In contexts related to \gls{ML} these objects are called tensors. Since they may not satisfy the mathematical definition of a tensor, in particular the map may not be multilinear and the numerical sets may not be vector spaces, no reference to such objects is made in this work.}
Latitude and longitude are the only spatial dimensions considered, because elevation is specific to each \gls{ECV}. In the following, when spatial dimensions are mentioned, they refer to the horiziontal dimensions of latitude and longitude.
Every numerical value is equipped with proper unit of measurement, to represent physical quantities correctly. As a consequence, the codomain in equation~\eqref{eq:math_variable} is partially wrong: with an abuse of notation, it represents only the magnitude of the \gls{ECV} and does not consider the unit of measurement. This is a small exception to simplify the notation and in the remainder of this document units of measurement are always addressed explicitly.

A more practical representation of $T$ is a multidimensional array, where values in the domain are coordinates associated to each dimension and each entry of the array is the result of $T$ evaluated on those coordinates.
In the following, this representation is used to simplify the discussion and same \gls{ECV} symbol is used both for the function and the multidimensional array.
\begin{example}
  \Glsdesc{tas}, symbol \gls{tas}, is available for some coordinates $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon}$ and timestamps $S_\text{time}$. It can be seen as the scalar function in equation~\eqref{eq:math_variable}, which associates each value in set $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{time}$ to a scalar value with unit \glssymbol{tas}, or it can be represented as a multidimensional array, where each entry is function~\eqref{eq:math_variable} evaluated at the corresponding coordinates.
\end{example}

As a visual aid when generic symbols are used, capital letters represent both functions and multidimensional arrays, the former being followed by the arguments in parentheses when there is an explicit reference to their values. Instead, lowercase letters are used for functions and values which are one dimensional.

A note on units of measurement: in atmospheric sciences and engineering applications it is common to use non-SI units because they are closer to everyday experience. Two notable cases in this work are: time expressed in number of days, $\qty{1}{\day} = \qty{86400}{\second}$, and precipitation flux expressed as precipitation rate, with the implicit conversion $\qty{1}{\milli\metre\per\day} = \qty{1}{\kilo\gram\per\square\metre\per\second} \frac{\qty{86400}{\second\per\day}}{\qty{1000}{\kilo\gram\per\cubic\metre}}$ using the density of water.



\subsection{Climate normals}
\label{sec:Climate normals}
The temporal evolution of climate is described by climate data which can be represented as time series. To quantify changes in the state of climate it is useful to define a reference period and climate data related to it.

The concept of climate \gls{normal} is introduced for this purpose, the \gls{WMO} defines it as: \glsdesc{normal}. Terms \gls{period_average} and \gls{average} apply to monthly values of climate data, see definitions and how normals are evaluated in \cite[5-6]{2017WorldMeteorologicalOrganizationWMOWMOGuidelines}. However, the mean of values with other temporal domains may also be useful, e.g. multimonth normals, normal for each day of year of the wind speed at a given location. In the following the averaging period is expressed clearly.
To quantify changes in the state of climate, \glspl{anomaly} are used, which are \glsdesc{anomaly}.

In this work the reference period is a period of 30 years starting on 1st January of a year ending with the digit 1. This specification satisfies the definition of averaging period for climate \glspl{normal}.
Instead, the boundaries are specific to the case study (see section~\ref{sec:Impact chain}).

In contrast to the reference period, averaging periods for future climate span 20 years and are fixed. Values referred to these periods describe the system or the climate at future time horizons, which is an useful information for any planning involving the system \cite[23]{2023CarlinThe2023}. The lower number of years in these periods do not affect negatively the prediction skill of statistics related to them \cite[17]{2017WorldMeteorologicalOrganizationWMOWMOGuidelines}.



\section{Indicators}
\label{sec:Indicators}
\Glspl{indicator} of \glspl{driver} within the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} are functions of climate data and additional parameters. In this work the climate data are \glspl{ECV} and they have a daily frequency.
During their calculation, generally \glspl{indicator} are aggregated over the temporal dimension and are non-linear functions of their arguments.
An \gls{indicator} $I$ can be defined mathematically as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:math_indicator}
  I : S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{y} \times \prod_{p \in P_I} S_p \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{y}$ is a set of the years considered during the analysis, $P_I$ is the set of parameters for that indicator and $S_p$ is the set of values available for each parameter $p \in P_I$.%
\footnote{As a symbolic shortcut, if $P_I = \varnothing$ then the indicator is defined only over $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon} \times S_\text{y}$.}
In the following, $\underline{z} \in \prod_{p \in P_I} S_p$ represents the set of arguments passed to the \gls{indicator}, in other words the coordinates of $I$ as multidimensional array.
Evaluation is performed for each year, i.e. the \gls{indicator} has yearly resolution or is evaluated with yearly frequency. As a consequence, the elements of set $S_\text{y}$ are references to the years taken into account during calculation.

An \gls{indicator} can be represented as a multidimensional array, similarly to \glspl{ECV}.
The dependence of an \gls{indicator} on \glspl{ECV} is not clear in the definition given by equation~\eqref{eq:math_indicator}, but in the following this is made explicit by the context or by the definition of the \gls{indicator}.

\begin{example}
  The \gls{indicator} $\mathrm{TX_x}$ is evaluated for the period 1991-2020 with yearly frequency. This \gls{indicator} is the monthly maximum value of daily maximum temperature \cite{ETCCDIClimate}, hence:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item it depends on \gls{ECV} \glsdesc{tasmax} defined at daily frequency over the considered period,
      \begin{equation*}
        S_\text{time} = \left\{ t : \parbox{0.45\linewidth}{$t$ day from \DTMdisplaydate{1991}{1}{1}{-1} to \DTMdisplaydate{2020}{12}{31}{-1}} \right\}
        \quad ;
      \end{equation*}
    \item spatial dimensions are not specified, hence the evaluation is performed for each point of an arbitrary set $S_\text{lat} \times S_\text{lon}$;
    \item no additional parameters are required, $P_\mathrm{TX_x} = \varnothing$;
    \item the outcome is a scalar value for each year in the period,
      \begin{equation*}
        S_\text{y} = \{ 1991, 1992, \dots, 2020 \}
        \quad ;
      \end{equation*}
    \item the multidimensional array representation of the \gls{indicator} has a real value with unit \unit{\kelvin} for each entry.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\Glspl{indicator} of \glspl{driver} within \gls{exposure} and \gls{vulnerability} \glspl{determinant} may be defined similarly as the \gls{hazard} \gls{determinant} as scalar functions depending on specific variables characterising the system.



\section{Structure of the document}
Each section of the document treats a different aspect of the analysis.
A general understanding of the concept of \gls{risk} and the associated terms are necessary to frame the problem. They are exposed in chapter~\ref{sec:Introduction}, along with useful concepts on climate and a mathematical description of climate data and \glspl{indicator}.

Data specific to the study and any elaboration applied to them are then presented in chapter~\ref{sec:Data and Methods}. Section~\ref{sec:Methodology of risk assessment} in particular describes the methodology of \gls{CCRA} which is followed in this work.

Results of the application of the methodology to the case study and the consequent \gls{SA} are in chapter~\ref{sec:Results and Discussion}, while chapter~\ref{sec:Conclusions} summarises the final considerations on this study and points of departure for future studies.
