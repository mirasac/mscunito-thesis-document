\section{Context and scope}
The methodology of \gls{CCRA} is applied in particular to Torino-Caselle airport, located near the municipality of Caselle Torinese, in the Metropolitan City of Turin, Italy.
The central coordinates for the grid cells are $(\qty{45.203}{\degreeNorth}, \qty{7.649}{\degreeEast})$ in decimal degrees. These data are derived from \gls{ENAC}, the Italian civil aviation authority \cite{2014ENACTorinoCaselle}.

The construction of the airport in its modern settings started in 1949 and major upgrades to infrastructures happened before 2006 (see \cite[18]{2015PudduCorporateSocial} for a summary on the history of the airport). Therefore, the reference period is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:period_reference_torino}
  \prd{S_\text{time}}{ref} = \{ t : \text{$t$ day from \DTMdisplaydate{1971}{1}{1}{-1} to \DTMdisplaydate{2000}{12}{31}{-1}} \}
  \quad .
\end{equation}
For the present \gls{CCRA}, the airport is considered unaffected by structural changes starting from year 2006. Hence \glspl{indicator} values for that year or closest to it are chosen.



\section{System-dependent data}
In section~\ref{sec:Impact chain} the reasons behind the selection of \glspl{indicator} are discussed. In this section their values related to Torino-Caselle airport are presented. Values of \gls{exposure} indicators are shown in table~\ref{tab:values_exposure}, values of \gls{vulnerability} are in table~\ref{tab:values_vulnerability}.
The exposure is quantified using data on the operativity of the airport and they are gathered from \cite[154-179]{2010OneWorksAtlanteDegli}.

  \label{tab:values_exposure}
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.33\textwidth}ccc}
    Indicator                        & Symbol        & Unit                 & Value  \\
    \hline
    Runways area                     & $\mathrm{e1}$ & \unit{\square\metre} & 198000 \\
    \hline
    Terminals area                   & $\mathrm{e2}$ & \unit{\square\metre} & 51150  \\
    Offices and other buildings area & $\mathrm{e3}$ & \unit{\square\metre} & 4245   \\
    Carparks number                  & $\mathrm{e4}$ &                      & 3000   \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Same source is used for values of \gls{sensitivity}. A note on the {Age buildings} indicator is due: following \cite[5]{2022DeVivoRiskAssessment}, it is the difference in years between the time of writing and the start of the construction of the airport, since the oldest components are supposed to be the most vulnerable. Because Torino-Caselle airport was subject to various changes, dating back before its designation for civil aviation, the year 1949 is approximated as the starting year for all operations and the lifecycle of the airport components. Instead, structural changes are supposed to end in year 2006, hence the age is evaluated between years 1949 and 2006. This is an heavy approximation because {Age buildings} is an indicator which directly states the passing of time. However, for the purposes of this study, this level of accuracy is considered acceptable as the focus is not on obtaining precise \gls{CCRA} results but on assessing how changes in parameters affect those results.
A more dynamic \gls{CCRA} methodology may be an interesting extension of the present study.

\Glspl{indicator} of \gls{adaptive_capacity} are mainly categorical and they are gathered from \cite[66-79]{2015PudduCorporateSocial}. For use in calculations, categorical values are converted to a numerical scale following \cite[6]{2023DeVivoClimate-RiskAssessment}. The target values are in the interval $[0, 1]$, with lower values indicating lower \gls{risk}. More in detail, the presence of mitigation or adaptation strategies scores \num{0.1}, while their absence scores \num{0.9}. Intermediate values correspond to the existence of plans that have not yet been implemented. For this reason, the values for the indicators {Risk awareness} and {Guidelines for adaptation plan to climate change} are set considering the planning for adaptation and mitigation strategies from the years after 2006.

\section{Outcome of the risk assessment}
Once the \gls{CCRA} methodology presented in section~\ref{sec:Methodology of risk assessment} is applied to the Torino-Caselle airport, different \gls{risk} values are obtained for different combinations of parameters values.
The sensitivity of risk on parameters then can be studied. In the following subsections the \gls{SA} is performed with the help of plots and for some possible applications.



\subsection{Temporal evolution of risk}
The first information which can be drawn is the evolution of \gls{risk} across the selected time horizons, for a given scenario. Figure~\ref{fig:ssp245_risk_heat_wave_index_thresh-heat_wave_max_length_thresh_tasmax} shows the change of risk for scenario SSP2-4.5 and how varying the threshold on \gls{tasmax} $\mathrm{p2}$ affects the outcome.
The remaining parameters are fixed to obtain the bidimensional plots displayed in the figure: all values are set to the 99th percentile except for $\mathrm{p1} = \qty{4}{\day}$, to include window spans used in definitions of extreme temperature event, and $\mathrm{p4} = \qty{5}{\day}$ as commonly used in similar indicators, e.g. $\mathrm{Rx5day}$ \cite[2208]{2021GutierrezAnnexVI}.
Quantiles at lower order correspond to lower temperature thresholds in each model. This allows more days each year being classified as heat wave events, therefore increasing the total risk value.

Overall, risk is higher for more distant time horizons, in accordance with the observations and predictions on climate change. Standard deviation of risk values increases as well, due to the differences between models, decreasing the accuracy on risk prediction.

In the near future risk values are limited to categories $\riski$, $\riskii$ $\riskiii$ and $\riskiv$. The medium-term future period presents a similar situation, with the exception of the $\riskv$ category being compatible only for the lowest value of $\mathrm{p2}$. From the point of view of the analyst, common choices of the threshold between the 90th and the 99th percentiles result in negligible difference on the \gls{CCRA} outcome.

The long-term period has a more dramatic outcome because the highest category of risk is more frequent, despite the increased uncertainties. In this case the selection of threshold value is critical, because it results in very different risk categories.

  \includegraphics*[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{torino/indicators/ssp245/risk/heat_wave_index_thresh}
  \caption{Outcome of the \gls{CCRA} for scenario SSP2-4.5. The threshold of \gls{tasmax} is varied and the other parameters are fixed to values $\mathrm{p1} = \qty{4}{\day}$, $\mathrm{p4} = \qty{5}{\day}$ and quantiles of order 0.99 for $\mathrm{p3}$ and $\mathrm{p5}$. The risk value is rescaled with respect to the risk of reference period \DTMdisplaydate{1971}{1}{1}{-1} to \DTMdisplaydate{2000}{12}{31}{-1}.}
  \label{fig:ssp245_risk_heat_wave_index_thresh-heat_wave_max_length_thresh_tasmax}
\end{figure}

The previous considerations are valid for outcomes of scenario SSP3-7.0, see figure~\ref{fig:ssp370_risk_heat_wave_index_thresh-heat_wave_max_length_thresh_tasmax}. According to the scenario definition, impacts of climate change are more intense and this is reflected in the long-term period, where threshold values up to 99th quantile result in risk compatible with the highest category.

  \centering
  \includegraphics*[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{torino/indicators/ssp370/risk/heat_wave_index_thresh}

  \label{fig:ssp370_risk_heat_wave_index_thresh-heat_wave_max_length_thresh_tasmax}
\end{figure}

Risk values for scenario SSP1-2.6 are not affected by climate change, as can be observed in figure~\ref{fig:ssp126_risk_heat_wave_index_thresh-heat_wave_max_length_thresh_tasmax}. All values are constant in time within the standard deviation of the model ensemble and the only difference between time horizons is the increase in the uncertainty. For this scenario, it is safe to assume that the choice of the threshold value from data of the reference period is robust for predictions of risk.
