My gratitude goes to Prof. Elisa Palazzi for her kindness and professionalism, Dr. Jacopo Grassi for his help and patience, having teached me the basics of topics this project is based on, and WSP Italia S.r.l., for the opportunity to develop the project in a company and the resources they provided. In particular I refer to Dr. Roberto Mezzalama, who accepted my request and shared ideas with enthusiasm, and to Dr. Massimo Dragan and his team, for the friendly hospitality during the months of work.
