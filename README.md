## Palette

To use the palette of colors in Inkscape or in GIMP, copy file `palette.gpl` to the right directory.
Colors in LaTeX are managed with package `xcolor` and they are defined in file `palette.tex`. This file must be inputted in the preamble among other packages.

These files are not linked together, hence if a new color should be added, it needs to be inserted manually in every file.
