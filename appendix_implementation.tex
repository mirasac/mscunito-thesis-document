\section{Selection of CMIP6 models}
\label{sec:Selection of CMIP6 models}
Some models available in NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 are excluded from the present study because they present issues which can not be contained without affecting the calculations. Table~\ref{tab:CMIP6_models} list both the used models and the excluded models, along with additional information.

The most frequent issue is the lack of data for some of the used \glspl{ECV} or for some \glspl{SSP}. On the contrary, model GISS-E2-1-G occasionally presents multiple values for the same day, hence to avoid introducing systematic errors on which values should be considered or how to aggregate them, the model is excluded from the list.

Finally, two models have temporal coordinates set on a different calendar than the one used in this work, namely a 360-day calendar. Calendars are defined by the \gls{MIP} endorsed \glspl{GCM} but no restriction is imposed on the possibility to convert from one to another.
