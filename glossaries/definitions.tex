  description={``The potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognizing the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change, risks can arise from potential impacts of climate change as well as human responses to climate change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including ecosystem services), ecosystems and species.'', from \cite[2246]{2021MatthewsAnnexVII}.

Note that this concept focues on the negative impacts of the physical drivers, the term \emph{Climatic impact-driver} is used for conditions with more general impacts (cfr. \cite[2224]{2021MatthewsAnnexVII}, \cite[10]{2020ReisingerGuidanceFor} and \cite[1871]{2021RanasingheClimateChange}).
